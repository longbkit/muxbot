# clisbot - Turn your favorite coding CLI into an agentic personal assistant, workplace assistant, coding partner - on the go
Want to use OpenClaw but are struggling because:

- API cost is too high, so you end up looking for LLM proxy workarounds
- you have to switch between OpenClaw for daily work and Claude / Codex / Gemini for real coding
- you want to code on the go and work on the go

`clisbot` is the right solution for you.

`clisbot` turns native frontier agent CLIs like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI into durable Slack and Telegram bots. Each agent runs inside its own tmux session, keeps a real workspace, and can behave like a coding bot, a daily-work assistant, or a team assistant with SOUL, IDENTITY, and MEMORY.

It is not just a tmux bridge with chat glued on top. `clisbot` treats Slack and Telegram as real channel surfaces with routing, durable conversation state, pairing, follow-up control, file sending and receiving, and the ability to keep frontier coding agents inside the tools and communication surfaces where teams already work.

`clisbot` is also meant to grow into a reusable agent runtime layer that can support many CLI tools, many channels, and many workflow shapes on top of the same durable agent session.

## Start Here By Goal

### I Want A Personal Coding Bot In Telegram Or Slack

- start with the [Quick Start](#quick-start)
- best fit when you want Codex, Claude, or Gemini available from chat without
  giving up a real workspace
- current release value: a much more AI-native control path, where the bot can
  increasingly set up `/queue`, loops, schedules, and other recurring work for
  you from normal chat instead of forcing you to memorize command syntax first

### I Want A Shared Team Bot

- start with [Quick Start](#quick-start), then read [Surface Access Model](#surface-access-model)
- best fit when you need one bot in a real Slack channel, Telegram group, or
  Telegram topic with explicit route and sender control
- current release value: safer shared-surface policy, tighter topic or thread
  isolation, per-group sender control, and permission boundaries that let one
  bot live in a team group without opening it to everyone there

### I Need Operator Control And Debugging

- start with [Common CLI commands](#common-cli-commands)
- most useful surfaces: `clisbot status`, `clisbot logs`,
  `clisbot watch --latest`, `clisbot inspect --latest`, and `clisbot queues`
- current release value: more truthful `sessionId`, lighter runner inventory,
  and less confusing restart behavior during updates

### I Just Want To Know What Changed Recently

- start with [Recent Release Highlights](#recent-release-highlights)
- then read [v0.1.45 Release Notes](docs/releases/v0.1.45.md) or the
  [v0.1.45 Release Guide](docs/updates/releases/v0.1.45-release-guide.md)

## Why I Built This

I’m Long Luong (Long), Co-founder & CTO of Vexere, Vietnam’s #1 transportation booking platform, where we also build SaaS and inventory distribution infrastructure for transportation operators. As we scale a 300-person company with a 100-member Engineering, Product, and Design team, I’ve been searching for the most practical way to roll out AI-native workflows across the organization.

The challenge is not whether AI is useful. It is how to make it work at enterprise scale without creating a fragmented, expensive, or ungovernable stack. In practice, that means solving several hard problems at once: cost control, workflow truthfulness, team accessibility, governance, and the ability to bring frontier AI into the real tools and communication surfaces where work already happens.

`clisbot` is the approach I landed on. Instead of building yet another isolated AI layer, it turns the coding CLIs we already trust into durable, chat-native agents that can work across Slack, Telegram, and real team workflows.

## Why clisbot

- One frontier-agent stack for both daily work and real coding. You do not need one product for assistant work and another for actual engineering work.
- Reuses native CLI subscriptions you already pay for, such as Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI, instead of pushing you toward a separate API-cost-heavy stack.
- Learns from and integrates the two biggest strengths that made OpenClaw popular: memory and native channel integration with deep, channel-specific conversation and presentation capabilities.
- Not just a tmux bridge. Slack and Telegram are treated as real channel surfaces with routing, thread or topic continuity, pairing, follow-up control, and attachment-aware interaction instead of plain text passthrough so you can work from your laptop or on the go without giving up a real coding workspace.
- Team-first by design, with `AGENTS`, `USER`, and `MEMORY` context bootstrapping shaped for shared team reality instead of only personal solo-assistant flows.
- Shared-surface permission control is a first-class feature: a bot can be in a team group but still answer only the specific people you allow there, while sensitive control actions stay behind explicit auth roles and permissions.
- Useful for coding, operations, teamwork, and general assistant work, with fast chat controls such as `!<command>`, `/bash <command>`, `/queue`, `/loop`, `/streaming`, and `/mention`.
- New in `v0.1.45`: the AI-native control experience is much better. You can increasingly ask the bot in normal chat to update itself and explain what changed, help with onboarding, add or configure bots and agents, or create recurring schedules and loops for you instead of relying only on slash commands.

## Who This Fits Best

- Anyone who wants a high-agency personal assistant with OpenClaw-style memory,
  workspace context, and a skill-oriented operating model that can do far more
  than a thin chat wrapper.
- Solo builders who want a real coding assistant in Telegram or Slack, backed
  by Codex, Claude, or Gemini, without rebuilding their workflow around a new
  web product.
- Team leads who want one shared bot with explicit group or topic safety,
  durable context, and attachment-aware chat workflows.

## Surface Access Model

The important current config mental model is:

- `app`
- `bots`
- `agents`

Inside each bot:

- `directMessages` is the one-person surface map
- `groups` is the multi-user surface map
- stored keys use raw provider-local ids plus `*`

Examples:

- Slack shared surface: `groups["C1234567890"]`
- Telegram group: `groups["-1001234567890"]`
- Telegram topic: `groups["-1001234567890"].topics["42"]`
- DM wildcard default: `directMessages["*"]`

Operator CLI ids stay prefixed:

- `dm:<id>`
- `dm:*`
- `group:<id>`
- `group:*`
- `topic:<chatId>:<topicId>`

Current invariants:

- Slack `channel:<id>` is compatibility input only, not canonical operator naming
- stored config under one bot uses only raw ids plus `*` inside `directMessages` and `groups`
- `group:*` is the default multi-user sender policy node for one bot and should be updated or disabled, not removed
- `disabled` means silent for everyone on that surface, including owner/admin and pairing guidance
- owner/admin do not bypass `groupPolicy`/`channelPolicy` admission; after a group is admitted and enabled, they bypass sender allowlists, while `blockUsers` still wins
- the deny message intentionally uses one common human-facing term, `group`, for every multi-user surface

## CLI Compatibility Snapshot

`clisbot` currently works well with Codex, Claude, and Gemini.

| CLI      | Current Stability   | Short Take                                                                                                  |
| ----------| ---------------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `codex`  | Best today          | Strongest default for routed coding work.                                                                   |
| `claude` | Usable with caveats | Claude can surface its own plan-approval and auto-mode behavior even when launched with bypass-permissions. |
| `gemini` | Fully compatible   | Gemini is supported as a first-class runner for routed Slack and Telegram workflows.                         |

## Quick Start

Platform support:

- Linux and macOS are the supported host environments today.
- Native Windows is not supported yet because `clisbot` currently depends on `tmux` and Bash-based runtime flows.
- If you use Windows, run `clisbot` inside WSL2.

Most people should start here:

```bash
npm install -g clisbot
clisbot start \
  --cli codex \
  --bot-type personal \
  --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token> \
  --persist
```

If you want to try first without persisting the token yet, just remove `--persist`.
Day-to-day rescue commands are `clisbot stop`, `clisbot restart`,
`clisbot status`, and `clisbot logs`.

Next steps:

- For security, DMs default to pairing.
- `clisbot` also has a smart autopairing path to reduce first-run friction. If
  you send the bot a DM within the first 30 minutes, you can usually claim the
  owner role immediately and start using it without a separate pairing round.
- New from `v0.1.45`: the AI-native operator experience is much stronger. You
  can increasingly ask the bot through chat to explain how to use it, update
  itself and summarize what's new, help onboard you, create or add a new bot or
  agent, or set up loops and schedules for recurring work instead of relying
  only on slash commands.
- Existing configs from any version before `0.1.45` update directly to `0.1.45` automatically on first run. clisbot writes a backup first under `~/.clisbot/backups/`, then rewrites the config to the current shape.
- Shared Slack channels, Slack groups, Telegram groups, and Telegram topics are a separate gate: normal users need an explicit route such as `group:<id>` or `topic:<chatId>:<topicId>` before the bot will talk there. Legacy Slack `channel:<id>` input still works for compatibility.
- After a shared surface is admitted, per-surface sender control comes from the bot's default shared rule `groups["*"]` plus any route-local `allowUsers` or `blockUsers`.
- With that permission model, a bot can be added to a team group but still be
  allowed to answer only some people in that group.
- If the effective shared policy is `disabled`, the bot stays silent there for everyone, including owner/admin.
- If the effective shared policy is `allowlist` and a sender is not allowed, the bot denies before the runner:
  - `You are not allowed to use this bot in this group. Ask a bot owner or admin to add you to \`allowUsers\` for this surface.`
- To chat with the bot in a group:
  - telegram: Add the bot to the group, then use `/start` there. It will guide
    you toward the route you need to add. You can run that command directly or
    copy it into a DM with the bot and ask it to do the setup for you if you
    are already authorized.
  - slack: similar flow, but Slack-native slash command handling is awkward.
    Use a leading space such as ` /start`, or use the alias `\start`. The same
    workaround applies to other slash commands such as ` /streaming on` or
    `\mention`.
  - group conversations require a mention by default to avoid abuse, but smart
    follow-up stays open for a short window so you do not need to tag the bot
    again on every reply. You can also ask the bot to change that mode for you.
  - If you want stricter mention behavior, use `/mention` for this conversation only, `/mention channel` for the current channel or group default, or `/mention all` for the current bot default.
  - For long running tasks such as coding, turn streaming on with `/streaming on`
    and check it with `/streaming status`. In Slack, use a leading space such
    as ` /streaming on` or the alias `\streaming on`.
- If you want to add more owner or app admin, grant that principal explicitly with the platform prefix plus the channel-native user id, for example `clisbot auth add-user app --role owner --user telegram:1276408333` or `clisbot auth add-user app --role admin --user slack:U123ABC456`.
- `clisbot auth --help` now covers role scopes, permission sets, and add/remove flows for users and permissions.
- App-level auth and owner-claim semantics in [Authorization And Roles](docs/user-guide/auth-and-roles.md) describe both the current runtime reality and the remaining target-model gaps.

Need the step-by-step setup docs instead of the shortest path?

- Telegram: [Telegram Bot Setup](docs/user-guide/telegram-setup.md)
- Slack: [Slack App Setup](docs/user-guide/slack-setup.md)
- Release history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [release notes](docs/releases/README.md), [update guide](docs/updates/update-guide.md), [release guides](docs/updates/README.md), and [migration index](docs/migrations/index.md)
- Slack app manifest template: [app-manifest.json](templates/slack/default/app-manifest.json)
- Slack app manifest guide: [app-manifest-guide.md](templates/slack/default/app-manifest-guide.md)

What happens next:

- `--bot-type personal` creates one assistant for one human
- `--bot-type team` creates one shared assistant for a team, channel, or group workflow
- literal token input stays in memory unless you also pass `--persist`
- `--persist` promotes the token into the canonical credential file so the next `clisbot start` can reuse it without retyping
- fresh bootstrap only enables the channels you name explicitly
- after the persisted first run, later restarts can use plain `clisbot start`

## Recent Release Highlights

- `v0.1.45`: a much more AI-native operator experience, where you can
  increasingly talk to the bot to manage itself; plus safer personal and team
  bots in real Slack and Telegram groups, automatic direct updates from older
  installs, durable queue control, clearer session continuity truth, more
  reliable scheduled loops, stronger trust/restart behavior, and stricter
  streaming/session isolation.
- `v0.1.43`: more durable runtime recovery, clearer routed follow-up controls, more truthful tmux prompt submission checks, better queued-start notifications, and safer Slack thread attachment behavior.

What `v0.1.45` most likely means for you:

- The headline is AI-native control: ask the bot in chat to queue work,
  schedule recurring briefs, help update itself, explain release changes, or
  guide setup and routing instead of dropping to the shell for every action.
- personal user: fewer fragile long-run failures, better `/queue`, better media
  handling on Telegram
- shared bot owner: clearer route safety, easier direct upgrade from older
  installs, and more interesting team use cases where one bot lives in the
  group but only responds to selected people there
- operator: better queue visibility, better session continuity truth, and
  restart behavior that is less misleading during updates, plus faster
  `watch` and `inspect` shortcuts when something goes wrong

There are many more useful fixes and operator improvements in the full release
notes, including config update safety, CLI help, setup docs, runner debugging,
route policy behavior, channel-specific polish, and the broader AI-native
workflow direction behind this release.

If you prefer Slack first:

```bash
clisbot start \
  --cli codex \
  --bot-type team \
  --slack-app-token SLACK_APP_TOKEN \
  --slack-bot-token SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
```

Short alias:

```bash
clis start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token>
```

Local repo path:

```bash
bun install
bun run start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token> --persist
```

Repo-local `bun run start|stop|restart|status|logs|init|pairing` is pinned by `.env` to `CLISBOT_HOME=~/.clisbot-dev`, so local testing does not accidentally reuse your main `~/.clisbot` runtime.

Update note for existing installs:

- Older installs before `v0.1.45` now update directly on first run with a
  backup written first, so most people can update and restart without a manual
  migration pass.
- After you are on `v0.1.45`, future upgrades should feel much more AI-native:
  in many cases you can simply ask the bot to update `clisbot` to the latest
  version, and it can follow the update guide, perform the upgrade flow, then
  brief you on what changed.
- If you still want an agent to inspect your current config before updating,
  ask Codex or Claude in this repo to review it first.
- The manual package upgrade path is now simpler:

```bash
npm install -g clisbot && clisbot restart
clisbot --version
```

First conversation path:

- send a DM to the bot in Slack or Telegram
- if that principal is already app `owner` or app `admin`, pairing is bypassed and the bot should answer normally
- otherwise, `clisbot` defaults DMs to pairing mode and replies with a pairing code plus approval command

Approve it with:

```bash
clisbot pairing approve slack <CODE>
clisbot pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

Fresh config starts with no configured agents, so first-run `clisbot start` requires both `--cli` and `--bot-type` before it creates the first `default` agent.
Fresh config also starts with no preconfigured Slack channels or Telegram groups or topics. Add those routes manually in `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json`.
`clisbot start` requires explicit channel token input before it bootstraps anything. You can pass raw values, env names such as `MY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, or placeholders such as `'${MY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}'`.
If you want a separate dev instance beside your main bot, see the [Development Guide](docs/development/README.md).

## Showcase

The goal is a real chat-native agent surface, not a terminal transcript mirror: threads, topics, follow-up behavior, and file-aware workflows should feel native to Slack and Telegram.

## Important caution

Strong vendor investment in security and safety does not make frontier agentic CLI tools inherently safe. `clisbot` exposes those tools more broadly through chat and workflow surfaces, so you should treat the whole system as high-trust software and use it at your own risk.

## Acknowledgements

`clisbot` would not exist without the ideas, momentum, and practical inspiration created by OpenClaw. Many configuration, routing, and workspace concepts here were learned from studying OpenClaw, then adapted to `clisbot`'s own direction. Respect and thanks to the OpenClaw project and community.

## Setup Guide

The easiest setup flow is still:

1. Install `clisbot`.
2. Run the quick start command above.
3. DM the bot; approve pairing unless that principal is already app `owner` or app `admin`.
4. Only move into advanced config after the first successful run.

If you want the repo-guided setup path:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI in this repo.
3. Ask it to help you set up `clisbot`.

The docs in this repo are kept current, including the [User Guide](docs/user-guide/README.md), so the agent should have enough context to walk you through setup, configuration, and troubleshooting directly inside the repo.
If anything goes wrong, the fastest rescue loop is usually `clisbot logs`,
`clisbot status`, `clisbot restart`, or if needed `clisbot stop --hard`
followed by `clisbot start`.
Also open the coding CLI directly inside the bot workspace, usually
`~/.clisbot/workspaces/default`, and make sure that CLI already works there.
That is one of the strongest end-to-end checks for bot health.

If you prefer to configure everything yourself:

1. Read the official config template in [config/clisbot.json.template](config/clisbot.json.template).
2. If you need the archived released snapshot for migration review, compare it with [config/clisbot.v0.1.43.json.template](config/clisbot.v0.1.43.json.template).
3. Copy the official template to `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` and adjust bots, routes, agents, workspaces, and policies for your environment.
4. Add agents through the CLI so tool defaults, startup options, and bootstrap templates stay consistent.
5. Optionally move stable channel secrets into env vars or canonical credential files after your first successful run.

Channel route setup is manual by design:

- fresh config does not auto-add Slack channels
- fresh config does not auto-add Telegram groups or topics
- add only the exact channel, group, topic, or DM routing you want to expose
- default bot credential setup lives in [docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md](docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md)

Advanced agent management:

- most users should stay on `clisbot start --cli ... --bot-type ...` and let first-run create the default agent
- if you need more than one agent, custom bot defaults, or manual route setup flows, use the `clisbot agents ...`, `clisbot bots ...`, and `clisbot routes ...` commands described in [docs/user-guide/README.md](docs/user-guide/README.md)
- README intentionally keeps that low-level surface out of the main onboarding path because the public first-run model is `--bot-type personal|team`, not internal template-mode naming
- fresh bot config still points at the `default` agent; if your first useful agent uses another id, update the fallback with `clisbot bots set-agent ...` or override it on a route with `clisbot routes set-agent ...`

Env-backed setup is still supported when you want config to reference an env name instead of persisting a credential file:

```bash
clisbot start \
  --cli codex \
  --bot-type personal \
  --slack-app-token CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN \
  --slack-bot-token CUSTOM_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
```

- these flags are written into `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` as `${ENV_NAME}` placeholders
- you can pass either `CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` or `'${CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN}'`
- use this path when you want config to point at env variable names you chose yourself
- keep env export details in [docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md](docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md) instead of front-loading them into quick start

## Troubleshooting

If the quick start does not work, check these in order:

- If setup feels unclear, open Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI in this repo and ask it to help using the local docs.
- If anything looks wrong, start with `clisbot logs`, `clisbot status`,
  `clisbot restart`, or if needed `clisbot stop --hard` followed by
  `clisbot start`.
- If config behavior is confusing, inspect [config/clisbot.json.template](config/clisbot.json.template) first, then compare it with [docs/user-guide/README.md](docs/user-guide/README.md).
- If `clisbot start` says no agents are configured, prefer `clisbot start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token>`.
- If `clisbot start` prints token refs as `missing`, either pass the token explicitly on the command line or switch to env-backed setup described in [docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md](docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md).
- If `clisbot status` shows `bootstrap=...:missing` or `bootstrap=...:not-bootstrapped`, follow the advanced agent bootstrap steps in [docs/user-guide/README.md](docs/user-guide/README.md).
- Trust is usually handled automatically by the bot, but if trust or startup
  behavior still looks wrong, go to the workspace and launch the underlying CLI
  there directly, for example `cd ~/.clisbot/workspaces/default` and start
  `codex`, `claude`, or `gemini` yourself. If the CLI cannot start cleanly in
  that workspace, the bot will not be healthy either.
- If Gemini startup says it is waiting for manual authorization, authenticate Gemini directly first or provide a headless auth path such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` or Vertex AI credentials; `clisbot` now treats that screen as a startup blocker instead of a healthy ready session.
- If Codex warns that `bubblewrap` is missing on Linux, install `bubblewrap` in the runtime environment.
- If the bot does not answer, check `clisbot status` first. Healthy channels should show `connection=active`; if a channel stays `starting`, inspect `clisbot logs`.
- If a routed message was accepted but no reply arrives, send one test message
  and immediately run `clisbot watch --latest --lines 100` in a terminal. This
  shows the live tmux runner pane and usually reveals missing CLI auth, trust
  prompts, stuck startup, or model/provider errors.
- If Codex works in your normal terminal but the routed runner shows `Missing environment variable: CODEX_CLIPROXYAPI_KEY`, remember that `clisbot` runs Codex from a detached background process and tmux session. Start or restart `clisbot` from a shell where `echo $CODEX_CLIPROXYAPI_KEY` prints a value, or export the key in the environment used by your service manager. Existing tmux runner sessions keep their old environment, so recycle them after fixing env.
- If runtime startup still fails, run `clisbot logs` and inspect the recent log tail that `clisbot` now prints automatically on startup failure.
- If `clisbot restart` warns that stop timed out during an update, run `clisbot status` once. Current releases should continue cleanly when status already shows the worker exited; only treat it as a real bug if restart leaves the runtime down.
- If a normal restart is not enough, use `clisbot stop --hard` to stop the runtime and kill all tmux runner sessions on the configured clisbot socket, then start again from a shell with the correct environment.
- If you need the full command list, run `clisbot --help`.
- If you need step-by-step operator docs, start with [docs/user-guide/README.md](docs/user-guide/README.md).
- If Slack thread behavior feels too eager, use `/followup pause` or `/followup mention-only`.
- If Slack slash commands conflict with Slack-native command handling, add a leading space, for example ` /bash ls -la`.

## Common CLI commands

Most users only need a small set of commands at first:

- `clisbot start`: start the bot runtime and create the default first-run setup when needed.
- `clisbot restart`: restart the runtime cleanly; use this first when the bot stops responding.
- `clisbot stop`: stop the runtime cleanly before updates, config changes, or maintenance.
- `clisbot stop --hard`: stop the runtime and kill all tmux runner sessions on the configured clisbot socket; use this when stale runner panes, old environment variables, or stuck sessions survive a normal restart.
- `clisbot status`: check whether the runtime, channels, and active sessions look healthy.
- `clisbot logs`: inspect recent runtime logs when startup, routing, or replies look wrong.
- `clisbot runner list`: list the live tmux-backed runner sessions and see what is active.
- `clisbot inspect --latest`: capture the current pane state of the newest
  admitted session once.
- `clisbot watch --latest --lines 100`: jump straight into the newest admitted
  live session with enough context to debug a just-submitted message.
- `clisbot watch --index 2`: follow the second most recent admitted session
  without needing to copy a tmux session name first.
- `clisbot queues list`: inspect pending durable queued prompts across the app.
- `clisbot queues create --channel telegram --target group:-1001234567890 --topic-id 4335 --sender telegram:1276408333 <prompt>`: create one durable same-session queued prompt, capped by `control.queue.maxPendingItemsPerSession` (default `20`).

- `bun run test`
- `bun run check`

## In Chat

`clisbot` supports a small set of chat-native commands for thread control and workflow acceleration inside Slack and Telegram.

Native coding-CLI command compatibility:

- `clisbot` only intercepts its own reserved chat commands
- any other native Claude, Codex, or Gemini command text is forwarded to the underlying CLI unchanged
- operator guide: [Native CLI Commands](docs/user-guide/native-cli-commands.md)

Slack note:

- To stop Slack from interpreting a slash command as a native Slack slash command, prefix it with a space.
- Example: ` /bash ls -la`
- Bash shorthand also works: `!ls -la`

Common commands:

- `/start`: show onboarding or route-status help for the current conversation.
- `/help`: show the available clisbot conversation commands.
- `/stop`: interrupt the current running turn.
- `/streaming on`, `/streaming off`, `/streaming status`: turn live progress on when you want to follow long coding work, then turn it back off when you only want final answers; in Slack, use ` /streaming on` or `\streaming on` when Slack grabs the raw slash command.
- `/followup status`, `/followup auto`, `/followup mention-only`, `/followup pause`, `/followup resume`: control whether the bot keeps naturally following the thread, stays quiet, or requires an explicit mention again; fast shorthands include `/mention`, `/pause`, and `/resume`.
- `/queue <message>`: queue the next prompt behind the current run so the bot can finish one thing, then keep going automatically without you babysitting every step.
- `/loop <schedule or count> <message>`: turn one instruction into repeated work, from recurring automation to brute-force progress like `/loop 3 tiếp đi em` when you want the AI to keep pushing instead of stopping early.

Why `/queue` and `/loop` matter:

- `/queue` is a very simple workflow primitive: stack the next prompts now, let the bot run them one by one later.
- `/loop` is the force multiplier: use it for recurring review/reporting, or just to keep the AI moving through multi-step coding work with less laziness and fewer early stops.

Examples:

- `/queue tiếp đi em`
- `/queue code review theo architecture, guideline và fix, test`
- `/loop 3 tiếp đi em`

## Roadmap

- Add more native CLIs, starting with a stronger Claude, Codex, and Gemini launch trio.
- Add more channels, starting from Slack and Telegram, then moving toward Zalo and other expansion surfaces.
- Add better workflow building blocks such as heartbeat, cron-style jobs, and stronger loop automation.
- Explore structured output, ACP, and native SDK integrations where they improve truthfulness or operator control.
- Explore more stable native messaging paths beyond tmux-pane capture over time.

## Current Focus

`clisbot` is growing toward a broader agent runtime layer:

- more CLI tool support beyond Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI
- more communication channels beyond Slack and Telegram
- simple workflow building blocks such as cron jobs, heartbeat jobs, and loops
- durable agent sessions, workspaces, follow-up policy, commands, attachments, and operator controls that stay reusable across all those surfaces
- stability and security stay at the top of the project focus; if you find an
  issue in either area, please report it

tmux is still the current stability boundary. One agent maps to one durable runner session in one workspace, and every CLI, channel, or workflow layer should route onto that durable runtime instead of recreating the agent from scratch.

## Completed

- [x] Multiple Codex, Claude, and Gemini sessions with streaming on/off support.
- [x] Stale tmux session cleanup and session resume.
- [x] OpenClaw-compatible configuration system.
- [x] Slack channel support with streaming and attachments, smart follow mode
- [x] Telegram channel support with streaming and attachments

## AI-Native Workflow

This repo also serves as a small example of an AI-native engineering workflow:

- simple `AGENTS.md`-style operating rules, with Claude and Gemini compatibility files able to symlink back to the same source
- lessons-learned docs to capture repeated feedback and pitfalls
- architecture docs used as a stable implementation contract
- end-to-end validation expectations to close the feedback loop for AI agents
- workflow docs for shortest-review-first artifacts, repeated review loops, and task-readiness shaping in [docs/workflow/README.md](docs/workflow/README.md)

## Contributing

Merge requests are welcome.

MRs with real tests, screenshots, or recordings of the behavior under test will be merged faster.
