# Configuration Tests

## Purpose

These test cases define the expected behavior of configuration as the local control plane for `clisbot`.

They cover config bootstrap, env substitution, and how the system wiring is resolved across channels, the agents layer, runners, and control.

## Test Case 1: Default Config Bootstrap Works

### Preconditions

- `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` does not exist

### Steps

1. Run `bun run init`
2. Open the generated config file

### Expected Results

- the file is created at `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json`
- the tmux socket path is `~/.clisbot/state/clisbot.sock`
- the default agent workspace is `~/.clisbot/workspaces/default`
- the generated Slack default bot keeps `directMessages: {}` and creates wildcard defaults at `defaults.directMessages["*"]` and `defaults.groups["*"]`
- the generated Telegram default bot keeps `directMessages: {}` and creates wildcard defaults at `defaults.directMessages["*"]` and `defaults.groups["*"]`

## Test Case 2: Start Refuses First Run Without Default Channel Tokens

### Preconditions

- `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` does not exist
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` are all unset

### Steps

1. Run `bun run start`

### Expected Results

- `clisbot` prints a warning instead of starting
- `clisbot` points the operator to `docs/user-guide/bots-and-credentials.md`
- `clisbot` does not create the runtime config or pid state

## Test Case 3: Env Substitution Fails Loudly On Missing Vars

### Preconditions

- one required Slack env var is unset

### Steps

1. Attempt to load the config through the normal startup path

### Expected Results

- startup fails clearly
- the failure points to the missing environment variable instead of silently misconfiguring the runtime
- the operator sees a friendly error message without a raw source-code exception dump

## Test Case 4: Channel Route Policy Resolves Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with at least one explicit channel route

### Steps

1. Add one explicit Slack channel route and one explicit Slack MPIM route
2. Leave another Slack channel and another Slack MPIM route unconfigured
3. Send traffic from the configured shared routes
4. Send traffic from the unconfigured shared routes as a normal user
5. Tighten the shared wildcard sender route to `allowlist`, then verify only allowlisted senders may talk inside the configured shared routes

### Expected Results

- configured shared routes are admitted and route to the configured agent
- unconfigured shared routes are rejected for normal users when `groupPolicy` or Slack `channelPolicy` is `allowlist`, even if `groups["*"]` exists
- `groups["*"]` changes sender policy only after the shared surface is admitted
- shared-surface admission depends on `groupPolicy` or Slack `channelPolicy`; sender allowlists live on `groups["*"]` and exact routes

## Test Case 5: Runner And Interaction Policy Resolve From One Config Source

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with at least one agent definition and one channel route

### Steps

1. configure an agent to use the tmux runner
2. configure the default interaction policy for that route to use chat-first rendering
3. configure an explicit transcript request command pattern for that route
4. configure `streaming` and `response` for that route
5. start the service and inspect the resolved runtime wiring

### Expected Results

- runner selection comes from explicit configuration rather than hidden defaults
- default chat rendering and transcript request behavior are resolved from the same config source
- `streaming: off | latest | all` and `response: all | final` resolve from the same config source
- channel edit-versus-append behavior is not overloaded into `streaming` policy
- the resolved system wiring is stable enough for operators and tests to predict behavior before sending traffic

## Test Case 6: Session Continuity Storage And Runner Session-Id Policy Resolve Together

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with one agent definition

### Steps

1. configure `session.storePath`
2. configure `runner.sessionId.create`
3. configure `runner.sessionId.capture`
4. configure `runner.sessionId.resume`
5. load the config through the normal runtime path

### Expected Results

- `session.storePath` resolves to an expanded absolute path
- the default config expresses a valid Codex-style session-id strategy
- Codex tool-created-id mode does not include an unused explicit `--session-id` arg
- the runtime can switch to an explicit-session-id strategy without code changes
- session-id bootstrap mechanics remain outside channel config and stay at the session/runner boundary

## Test Case 7: Follow-Up Policy Defaults Resolve Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with at least one Slack route

### Steps

1. configure one route with default follow-up mode set to natural continuation after bot reply
2. configure one route with default follow-up mode set to mention-only
3. configure one route with a specific follow-up participation TTL
4. load the config through the normal runtime path

### Expected Results

- the resolved config exposes one explicit default follow-up mode per route or inherited default
- the resolved config exposes the configured follow-up TTL in normalized form
- the follow-up defaults are clearly separate from `requireMention`, `streaming`, and `response`
- the config makes it possible to express OpenClaw-compatible bot-participated thread continuation without hardcoding the TTL
- minute-based config such as `participationTtlMin: 5` is the default user-facing form
- second-based config such as `participationTtlSec` is also accepted for tighter test cases

## Test Case 8: Slack Feedback Defaults Resolve Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with Slack enabled

### Steps

1. load the config without explicitly setting `bots.slack.defaults.ackReaction`
2. load the config without explicitly setting `bots.slack.defaults.typingReaction`
3. load the config without explicitly setting `bots.slack.defaults.processingStatus`
4. load the config again with all three values explicitly set

### Expected Results

- the default resolved Slack config exposes `ackReaction: ""`
- the default resolved Slack config exposes `typingReaction: ""`
- the default resolved Slack config exposes `processingStatus.enabled: true`
- the default resolved Slack config exposes `processingStatus.status: "Working..."`
- the default resolved Slack config exposes `processingStatus.loadingMessages: []`
- explicit values override the defaults without changing any other channel routing behavior

## Test Case 9: Config Reload Policy Resolves Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists

### Steps

1. load the config without explicitly setting `control.configReload`
2. load the config again with `control.configReload.watch: true`
3. load the config again with `control.configReload.watchDebounceMs` overridden

### Expected Results

- the default resolved config exposes `control.configReload.watch: false`
- the default resolved config exposes `control.configReload.watchDebounceMs: 250`
- explicit values override the defaults without affecting unrelated channel or agent settings

## Test Case 10: Stale tmux Cleanup Policy Resolves Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with at least one agent definition

### Steps

1. load the config without explicitly setting `agents.defaults.session.staleAfterMinutes`
2. load the config again with `agents.defaults.session.staleAfterMinutes` overridden
3. load the config again with `control.sessionCleanup.enabled` overridden
4. load the config again with `control.sessionCleanup.intervalMinutes` overridden

### Expected Results

- the default resolved config exposes `agents.defaults.session.staleAfterMinutes: 60`
- the default resolved config exposes `control.sessionCleanup.enabled: true`
- the default resolved config exposes `control.sessionCleanup.intervalMinutes: 5`
- explicit values override the defaults without changing session-id continuity config
- `staleAfterMinutes: 0` is treated as an explicit per-agent disable for stale tmux cleanup
- cleanup uses clisbot activity timestamps and skips busy sessions instead of inferring staleness from tmux CPU usage

## Test Case 11: DM Access Policy Resolves Predictably

### Preconditions

- a config file exists with Slack or Telegram enabled

### Steps

1. load the config without explicitly setting `directMessages.policy`
2. load the config without explicitly setting `directMessages.allowFrom`
3. load the config again with `directMessages.policy: "pairing"`
4. load the config again with `directMessages.policy: "allowlist"` and a non-empty `allowFrom`

### Expected Results

- the default resolved config exposes `directMessages.policy: "pairing"`
- the default resolved config exposes `directMessages.allowFrom: []`
- explicit DM access policies resolve without affecting unrelated route behavior
- `allowFrom` resolves as a plain sender list that is later merged with the runtime pairing store
