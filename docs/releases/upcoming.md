# Upcoming

Use this file as the staging area for work that is expected to become the next public release note.

For beta or pre-release builds, keep notes here until the public version ships. When the release note is cut, move the meaningful beta history into that version's `Pre-Release History` section.

## Summary

Durable one-shot queue control is being staged for the next release.

## Operator Impact

- None yet.

## Functional Changes

### Channels

- None yet.

### Auth

- None yet.

### Agents

- Added durable session-scoped queue items under `StoredSessionEntry.queues`.
  Chat `/queue`, route `additionalMessageMode: "queue"`, and `clisbot queues`
  now share the same queue item model.
- Added a configurable per-session pending queue limit:
  `control.queue.maxPendingItemsPerSession`, default `20` when omitted.

### Runners

- None yet.

### Control

- Added `clisbot queues list|status|create|clear` for app-wide or scoped queue
  inspection, explicit routed creation, and pending-only clear.

### Configuration

- Added optional `control.queue.maxPendingItemsPerSession`. The default config
  template omits it so future release defaults can change without pinning old
  generated config files.

### DX

- None yet.

## Non-Functional Changes

### Stability

- Fixed startup ready-pattern matching so stale prompt markers earlier in a tmux
  pane do not let first-submit proceed before the currently launching runner is
  actually ready.
- Fixed mid-run recovery for runners that use explicit session ids without a
  separate resume command; recovery now restarts with the stored id instead of
  clearing and rotating it.
- Fixed status-command session-id capture fallback so full-pane rewrites can
  still read the cleaned `/status` delta when the raw append exists but does
  not contain the session id.

### Security

### Architecture Conformance

### Runtime Benchmarks
