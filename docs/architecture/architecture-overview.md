# clisbot Architecture Overview

## Document Information

- **Created**: 2026-04-04
- **Purpose**: Show the top-level system shape and link to the governing architecture docs
- **Status**: Working architecture

## Governing References

Read this file as the map, then use the detail docs for the actual contract:

- [Surface Architecture](surface-architecture.md)
- [Runtime Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Model Taxonomy And Boundaries](model-taxonomy-and-boundaries.md)

If this overview and a detailed architecture doc diverge, the detailed doc wins.

## Core Decision

Keep the system split into six explicit product systems:

- channels
- auth
- control
- configuration
- agents
- runners

That boundary is the main architecture rule for the repository.

## Default Flow

```text
user message
  -> channel
  -> configuration resolves route + persisted policy inputs
  -> auth resolves effective permissions
  -> agents resolves agent + session key
  -> runner executes native CLI
  -> channel renders clean chat-first output
  -> control can inspect or intervene separately
```

## Persistence Rule

Persist only what must survive restarts.

Current durable examples:

- config
- processed event state
- session continuity metadata

Current session continuity metadata is intentionally small:

- `sessionKey`
- `agentId`
- `sessionId`
- `workspacePath`
- `runnerCommand`
- `runtime`
- `loops`
- `queues`
- `recentConversation`
- `updatedAt`

Do not treat tmux pane ids, tmux window ids, or other transient runner artifacts as canonical state in the agents layer.

## Ownership Rules

- Channels own user-facing interaction and presentation.
- Auth owns permission semantics, owner claim, and the contract between advisory and enforced behavior.
- Control owns operator-facing inspection and intervention surfaces, and consumes auth rules for operator checks.
- Configuration is the local control plane that wires the system together and stores the relevant policy config.
- The agents layer owns backend-agnostic agent, session, and workspace behavior.
- Runners own backend-specific execution behavior and normalize quirks behind one contract.

Current runtime naming should reflect that split clearly:

- `AgentService` is a thin facade at the runtime entrypoint
- `SessionService` is the session-owned runtime owner in `agents`
- `RunnerService` is the backend-owned runtime owner in `runners`

Current code is not fully converged on that split yet:

- `src/agents/runner-service.ts` still holds the `RunnerService`
  implementation today
- that file still carries some `SessionService`-owned continuity work
- treat the owner map above as the architecture target, not as a claim that
  file placement and continuity boundaries are already fully clean

## Why This Split Matters

If these systems blur together:

- backend quirks leak into product logic
- operator workflows drift into user-facing channels
- testing gets weaker because boundaries disappear
- future runner swaps become expensive
- the codebase becomes harder to refactor safely

## Detail Docs

- Use [surface-architecture.md](surface-architecture.md) for user-facing and operator-facing surface rules.
- Use [architecture.md](architecture.md) for agents, runner, persistence, and runtime contract rules.
- Use [model-taxonomy-and-boundaries.md](model-taxonomy-and-boundaries.md) for model ownership, lifecycle, and naming boundaries.
