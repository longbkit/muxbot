# tmux Submit Truthfulness And Telegram Send Reliability

## Summary

Investigate and fix cases where a routed user message appears to reach `clisbot`, but the tmux-backed agent session does not actually submit the prompt successfully on the first try.

The reported symptom is that the human sends a message, nothing gets processed, then asks again once or twice and only then the prompt takes effect. The issue is reported more often on Telegram than on Slack.

## Status

Planned

## Why

This is both a stability and delay problem.

If `clisbot` accepts a message but fails to truthfully complete the tmux submit path, the surface lies about the real system state:

- the channel thinks a prompt was sent
- the runner may still be idle
- the human waits and retries manually
- retries can later create duplicate or ambiguous execution if the first submit actually went through late

The fix must respect the project requirement that stability and speed are both first-class metrics. A naive retry policy that hides uncertainty by blindly re-sending input could make the system less truthful or create duplicate runs.

## Scope

- reproduce the failed-or-lost first-submit symptom on the current Telegram route and compare it against Slack
- trace the full path from channel event acceptance to tmux input injection and post-submit observation
- verify whether the failure comes from:
  - tmux input delivery not actually happening
  - Enter submission not reaching the pane
  - prompt submission succeeding but first-output observation being too weak or too delayed
  - channel-level busy-state or progress feedback masking a still-idle runner
- define a truthful success criterion for "submit completed" instead of assuming that sending keystrokes means the prompt is now running
- improve reliability without regressing visible latency or creating duplicate prompt submission
- add regression coverage for Telegram-heavy cases

## Current Truth

- the product currently treats delay and stability as explicit top-level metrics
- tmux submit latency is already measured in the Slack latency audit, but Telegram-specific submit reliability has not been audited the same way
- there is now a real user report that first-turn submit sometimes does not take effect until one or two extra follow-up messages are sent
- the issue appears more common on Telegram than on Slack, which suggests either different timing pressure, different follow-up behavior, or different visibility of a shared runner weakness

## Non-Goals

- papering over uncertainty by sending duplicate prompt submissions automatically
- optimizing only Slack while leaving Telegram reliability behind
- redesigning the whole runner architecture in this slice

## Subtasks

- [ ] capture a reproducible Telegram case with timing notes and runtime logs
- [ ] compare Telegram and Slack timing around `tmux-submit-start`, `tmux-submit-complete`, and first meaningful output
- [ ] verify whether tmux key injection and final Enter submission are actually reaching the pane in the failure case
- [ ] define a truthful post-submit observation rule that distinguishes "submitted and running" from "keystrokes attempted"
- [ ] fix the reliability gap without increasing duplicate-submit risk
- [ ] add automated coverage for the failing path and for no-duplicate guarantees
- [ ] document any new latency or reliability instrumentation needed for future audits

## Exit Criteria

- a normal routed Telegram message reliably causes prompt execution on the first try under the tested failure scenario
- the same fix does not regress Slack behavior
- `clisbot` does not silently double-submit prompts just to look responsive
- timing and status signals remain truthful enough for operators to debug real failures
