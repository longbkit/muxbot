# Agent Progress Replies

## Purpose

Use this page when you want to test the chatbot flow where Codex or Claude sends short progress updates back to Slack or Telegram while it is still working.

## What clisbot Does

Current local developer flow has three parts:

1. `clisbot` creates a stable local wrapper at `~/.clisbot/bin/clisbot`
2. runner-launched agent sessions get that wrapper path exported during startup
3. Slack and Telegram prepend a short hidden system block to the agent-bound prompt with the exact reply command for the current conversation

That means the agent can be running inside another workspace and still send progress updates with a machine-local command that does not depend on its current working directory.

## Fastest Test Flow

Start clisbot normally:

```bash
bun run start --cli codex --bootstrap team-assistant
```

Then:

1. send a real human message in the configured Slack or Telegram test surface
2. let clisbot route that message to the configured agent
3. the agent prompt now includes the exact local reply command for that conversation
4. the agent can send progress updates and the final reply through `clisbot message send ...`

Preferred reply pattern for multi-line or quote-heavy content:

```bash
~/.clisbot/bin/clisbot message send \
  --channel slack \
  --target channel:C1234567890 \
  --thread-id 1712345678.123456 \
  --message "$(cat <<\__CLISBOT_MESSAGE__
working on it

step 1 complete
__CLISBOT_MESSAGE__
)"
```

Why this exact form:

- keep the delimiter unquoted as `<<\__CLISBOT_MESSAGE__` so the rendered prompt carries fewer nested quotes and is less likely to break when another tool wraps it inside JSON or shell strings
- keep `__CLISBOT_MESSAGE__` alone on its own line when closing the heredoc
- this pattern is now regression-tested against multi-line text, mixed quotes, shell-like text, steering-style blocks, and markdown code fences

## Important Rules

- send a real human message to trigger the flow
- do not try to simulate the inbound user turn with `clisbot message send ...`
- the wrapper path is stable on the local machine: `~/.clisbot/bin/clisbot`
- use normal ASCII spaces when copying shell examples
- the injected prompt tells the agent to keep progress updates short
- current prompt policy defaults are:
  - at most `3` progress messages
  - exactly `1` final response

## Why The Wrapper Exists

Agent sessions do not run in the `clisbot` repo root.

So repo-local commands such as:

```bash
bun run src/main.ts message send ...
```

are poor runtime instructions for the agent.

The local wrapper fixes that by always pointing back to the active local `clisbot` checkout.

## Config

Slack and Telegram now expose a small prompt policy block:

```json
"agentPrompt": {
  "enabled": true,
  "maxProgressMessages": 3,
  "requireFinalResponse": true
}
```

If you disable `agentPrompt.enabled`, clisbot stops injecting the reply instruction block into agent-bound prompts for that provider.

User-visible reply delivery is configured beside `streaming` and `response`:

```json
"streaming": "off",
"response": "final",
"responseMode": "message-tool",
"additionalMessageMode": "steer"
```

- `capture-pane`: existing clisbot behavior. The channel posts progress or final settlement from normalized runner output.
- `message-tool`: clisbot still captures and observes the runner pane for state, but normal progress and final reply delivery are expected to happen through `clisbot message send ...` from the agent prompt flow.
- `steer`: when a session is already active, later human messages are sent straight into that live session as steering input.
- `queue`: when a session is already active, later human messages wait behind the current run and clisbot settles them one by one.

Use `message-tool` when you want to avoid duplicate replies or raw pane-derived final settlement while still keeping tmux observation available for status, attach, watch, and internal runtime logic.

Use `additionalMessageMode: "steer"` when you want natural chatbot follow-ups to influence the current active run immediately.

Use `additionalMessageMode: "queue"` when you want each later human message to become its own queued turn instead.

If the route keeps `streaming: "off"`, queued turns still settle through clisbot, but you should only expect the final queued answer on the surface, not an interim queued placeholder.

## Debug Reply Delay

When you need to measure where reply latency is happening, start clisbot with:

```bash
CLISBOT_DEBUG_LATENCY=1 clisbot start
```

Then reproduce the routed message and inspect the log:

```bash
clisbot logs | rg 'clisbot latency'
```

Latency stages currently include:

- `slack-event-accepted` or `telegram-event-accepted`
- `channel-enqueue-start`
- `ensure-session-ready-*`
- `runner-session-ready`
- `tmux-submit-start`
- `tmux-submit-complete`
- `tmux-first-meaningful-delta`

Read them as a handoff timeline:

- large gap before `channel-enqueue-start`: inbound surface handling or event duplication gating
- large gap inside `ensure-session-ready-*`: tmux startup, resume, or trust-prompt path
- large gap between `tmux-submit-complete` and `tmux-first-meaningful-delta`: the runner accepted input slowly or the pane did not visibly change yet

## Response Mode Precedence

Resolved `responseMode` now follows one order:

1. surface override
2. agent override
3. provider default
4. built-in default `message-tool`

That means clisbot still captures the pane in every case, but decides whether user-visible delivery comes from pane settlement or from `clisbot message send ...` using the first configured match above.

Top-level Slack example:

```json
"channels": {
  "slack": {
    "agentPrompt": {
      "enabled": true,
      "maxProgressMessages": 3,
      "requireFinalResponse": true
    },
    "streaming": "off",
    "response": "final",
    "responseMode": "message-tool",
    "additionalMessageMode": "steer"
  }
}
```

Slack channel override example:

```json
"channels": {
  "slack": {
    "streaming": "off",
    "response": "final",
    "responseMode": "message-tool",
    "additionalMessageMode": "steer",
    "channels": {
      "C1234567890": {
        "requireMention": true,
        "responseMode": "capture-pane",
        "additionalMessageMode": "queue"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Telegram group and topic override example:

```json
"channels": {
  "telegram": {
    "streaming": "off",
    "response": "final",
    "responseMode": "message-tool",
    "additionalMessageMode": "steer",
    "groups": {
      "-1001234567890": {
        "requireMention": false,
        "responseMode": "capture-pane",
        "additionalMessageMode": "queue",
        "topics": {
          "42": {
            "responseMode": "message-tool",
            "additionalMessageMode": "steer"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Interpretation:

- top-level `responseMode` is the provider default
- top-level `additionalMessageMode` is the provider default for busy-session follow-up
- `agents.list[].responseMode` overrides the provider default for that one agent
- `agents.list[].additionalMessageMode` overrides the provider default for that one agent
- a Slack channel route can override it per channel
- a Telegram group can override it per group
- a Telegram topic can override the parent group again for that one topic

Agent override example:

```json
"agents": {
  "list": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "responseMode": "message-tool",
      "additionalMessageMode": "steer"
    },
    {
      "id": "reviewer",
      "responseMode": "capture-pane",
      "additionalMessageMode": "queue"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `/responsemode status` shows the active route value plus the current persisted surface target value.
- `/additionalmessagemode status` shows the active route busy-session behavior plus the current persisted surface target value.
- `/queue <message>` always queues that one extra message, even when the surface default is `steer`.
- `\q <message>` is a shortcut alias for `/queue <message>`.
- `/steer <message>` and `\s <message>` inject a steering message into the active run immediately.
- `/queue-list` shows queued messages for the current conversation that have not started yet.
- `/queue-clear` clears queued messages for the current conversation that have not started yet.
