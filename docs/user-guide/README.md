# User Guide

## Purpose

Use `docs/user-guide/` for operator-facing instructions on how to run, inspect, and troubleshoot `clisbot`.

This folder should explain:

- how to start and inspect the service
- how to interact with the dedicated tmux server
- where runtime state lives
- where channel-specific operating notes live
- how config reload works in practice
- how stale tmux cleanup and sensitive commands work in practice
- how app ownership, roles, and privileged actions are expected to work for operators

If setup is unclear, clone this repo, open it in Codex or Claude Code, and ask it to help set up `clisbot`. The docs here are kept current enough for guided setup and troubleshooting.

## CLI-Specific Notes

If you are choosing a default coding CLI or debugging routed behavior, start here:

- [Codex CLI Guide](codex-cli.md)
- [Claude CLI Guide](claude-cli.md)
- [Gemini CLI Guide](gemini-cli.md)

## Platform Support

- Linux and macOS are the supported host environments today.
- Native Windows is not supported yet because `clisbot` currently depends on `tmux`, a dedicated tmux socket, and Bash-based runtime helpers.
- If you use Windows, run `clisbot` inside WSL2 and follow the normal Linux-style setup from that WSL2 shell.

## Service

Default config path:

`~/.clisbot/clisbot.json`

Bootstrap the default config once:

```bash
bun run init
```

Fastest path:

```bash
bun run start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token>
```

Focused help exists for first-run bootstrap too:

```bash
clisbot start --help
clisbot init --help
```

For durable one-shot follow-up work, use `clisbot queues --help`. Queue
creation requires explicit routed addressing plus `--sender`; there is no
ambient `--current` mode, and queue commands use `--channel/--target`
addressing.

After your first successful `clisbot start`:

1. Get your principal from a surface the bot can already see:
   Telegram groups or topics can use `/whoami` even before routing, while DMs with `pairing` policy need pairing first.
   `/whoami` and routed `/start` show:
   - `principal`
   - `principalFormat`
   - `principalExample`
   Routed `/whoami` also shows `storedSessionId` so you can inspect the persisted session continuity directly from chat.
   Typical values look like `telegram:1276408333` or `slack:U123ABC456`.
2. Grant the first app owner with `clisbot auth add-user app --role owner --user <principal>`, for example `clisbot auth add-user app --role owner --user telegram:1276408333`.
3. Inspect and tune role permissions with `clisbot auth --help`.
4. Continue with route setup in [Channel Operations](channels.md) and auth details in [Authorization And Roles](auth-and-roles.md).

Persist the token for later plain `clisbot start` runs:

```bash
clisbot start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token> --persist
```

If you use the packaged CLI:

```bash
clisbot start --cli codex --bot-type personal --telegram-bot-token <your-telegram-bot-token> --persist
```

Packaged CLI runtime expects Node 20+.

Native Windows shells such as PowerShell or Command Prompt are not supported for runtime operation. Use WSL2 instead.

Start the service in the foreground:

```bash
bun run start
```

Start the packaged CLI in the background:

```bash
npx clisbot start
```

Restart the packaged CLI:

```bash
clisbot restart
```

Stop the packaged CLI:

```bash
clisbot stop
```

Stop the packaged CLI and clean up all tmux sessions on the clisbot socket:

```bash
clisbot stop --hard
```

Start the service in dev mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Print the resolved default config path:

```bash
clisbot status
```

Important distinction:

- `clisbot start` seeds `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` automatically if it does not exist
- `clisbot start` requires Slack or Telegram token references before it bootstraps anything
- when no agents exist yet, `start` requires both `--cli` and `--bot-type` to create the first `default` agent
- `--slack-app-token`, `--slack-bot-token`, and `--telegram-bot-token` accept either bare env names like `CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` or placeholder form like `${CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN}`
- `clisbot start` prints which token refs or credential sources it is using for the channels you requested
- existing enabled channel token refs are validated before the detached runtime is spawned
- fresh bootstrap enables only the channels and bots you named explicitly with flags
- `--persist` writes canonical credential files for any literal channel tokens from that invocation, so later plain `clisbot start` can reuse them
- Gemini-first setups also need Gemini itself to already be authenticated for routed use, either by a prior direct `gemini` login or by headless auth such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` or Vertex AI credentials
- the generated default config does not preseed Slack channel routes, Slack groups, Telegram groups, or Telegram topics
- you must add channel routes manually in `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json`
- `clisbot start` prints a brief agents and channels summary after launch
- `clisbot start` and `clisbot status` print the primary agent workspace before the config path
- that workspace is the default working directory for the agent and contains runtime state, sessions, personality files, and setup guidance
- when no agents exist yet, `clisbot start` prints first-run guidance for direct `start --cli ... --bot-type ...` usage and bootstrap completion
- `clisbot start` runs as a background service and writes runtime pid and log files under `~/.clisbot/state`
- `bun run dev` watches source files in this repo
- `control.configReload.watch` watches the runtime config file
- these are separate mechanisms

## Agents CLI

Use `clisbot agents ...` to manage configured agents, bootstrap files, and agent-local mode overrides.

Focused help:

```bash
clisbot agents --help
```

Most-used commands:

- `clisbot agents list`
- `clisbot agents list --json`
- `clisbot agents add <id> --cli <codex|claude|gemini>`
- `clisbot agents bootstrap <id> --bot-type <personal|team>`
- `clisbot agents response-mode status --agent <id>`
- `clisbot agents response-mode set <capture-pane|message-tool> --agent <id>`
- `clisbot agents response-mode clear --agent <id>`
- `clisbot agents additional-message-mode status --agent <id>`
- `clisbot agents additional-message-mode set <queue|steer> --agent <id>`
- `clisbot agents additional-message-mode clear --agent <id>`

Important rules:

- `agents add` requires `--cli`
- supported tools are `codex`, `claude`, and `gemini`
- `agents bootstrap` requires `--bot-type`
- first-run public choices stay `--bot-type personal|team`
- bot fallback routing now belongs to `clisbot bots ...`
- route-level routing now belongs to `clisbot routes ...`

Bootstrap behavior:

- `personal-assistant` and `team-assistant` copy the matching bootstrap templates
- codex bootstrap requires `AGENTS.md` and `IDENTITY.md`
- claude bootstrap requires `CLAUDE.md` and `IDENTITY.md`
- gemini bootstrap requires `GEMINI.md` and `IDENTITY.md`
- bootstrap state is `missing`, `not-bootstrapped`, or `bootstrapped`
- Gemini still needs its own direct auth or headless auth path before routed prompts can succeed

Operational note:

- the default generated bot config still points at the `default` agent
- if your first useful agent uses another id, update the fallback with `clisbot bots set-agent ...` or override it on a specific route with `clisbot routes set-agent ...`

## Bots CLI

Use `clisbot bots ...` to manage provider bot identities, credentials, default bot selection, and bot-level fallback policy.

Focused help:

```bash
clisbot bots --help
```

Most-used commands:

- `clisbot bots list`
- `clisbot bots add --channel telegram --bot default --bot-token TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN --persist`
- `clisbot bots add --channel slack --bot default --app-token SLACK_APP_TOKEN --bot-token SLACK_BOT_TOKEN --persist`
- `clisbot bots set-agent --channel telegram --bot default --agent support`
- `clisbot bots set-default --channel slack --bot ops`
- `clisbot bots get-credentials-source --channel slack --bot default`
- `clisbot bots set-dm-policy --channel telegram --bot default --policy pairing`

## Routes CLI

Use `clisbot routes ...` to admit specific Slack or Telegram surfaces under a bot.

Focused help:

```bash
clisbot routes --help
```

Most-used commands:

- `clisbot routes list`
- `clisbot routes add --channel slack group:C1234567890 --bot default`
- `clisbot routes add --channel slack group:G1234567890 --bot default`
- `clisbot routes add --channel telegram group:-1001234567890 --bot default`
- `clisbot routes add --channel telegram topic:-1001234567890:42 --bot default`
- `clisbot routes add --channel telegram dm:* --bot default`
- `clisbot routes set-agent --channel slack group:C1234567890 --bot default --agent support`
- `clisbot routes set-require-mention --channel telegram group:-1001234567890 --bot default --value false`
- `clisbot routes set-response-mode --channel slack group:C1234567890 --bot default --mode message-tool`
- `clisbot routes set-additional-message-mode --channel telegram topic:-1001234567890:42 --bot default --mode queue`

Important behavior:

- preferred route ids are `group:<id>`, `group:*`, `topic:<chatId>:<topicId>`, and `dm:<id|*>`
- stored config uses raw ids plus `*` inside `directMessages` and `groups`
- legacy Slack `channel:<id>` input is still accepted for compatibility
- `group:*` is the default multi-user sender policy node of a bot
- `disabled` means truly silent, including owner/admin and pairing guidance
- owner/admin do not bypass `groupPolicy`/`channelPolicy` admission; after a group is admitted and enabled, they bypass sender allowlists, while `blockUsers` still wins
- `add` is create-only
- if the route already exists, use the matching `set-<key>` command
- route-local auth visibility still depends on `verbose` and resolved auth roles
  - `/loop 3 /codereview`
  - `/loop 3`
  - `/loop status`
  - `/loop cancel <id>`
- every `/loop` command must include an interval, count, or wall-clock schedule
- if no prompt is supplied after that interval, count, or schedule, clisbot uses the workspace `LOOP.md` file
- bare positive integers in `/loop` mean times mode, compact durations such as `5m` mean interval mode, and `every ... at HH:MM` means wall-clock schedule mode
- interval loops must be at least `1m`
- interval loops below `5m` require `--force`
- with leading interval syntax, place `--force` immediately after the interval token
- with `every ...` syntax, place `--force` immediately after the interval clause
- advanced recurring loop creation also accepts `--loop-start <none|brief|full>` to override the default scheduled start notification behavior for that one loop; omit it to keep the route default
- wall-clock schedules must use `HH:MM` in 24-hour format and wait until the next matching local time instead of firing immediately
- wall-clock schedules resolve timezone from the effective timezone resolver: one-off loop override, route/topic, agent, bot, `app.timezone`, legacy fallbacks, then host fallback only when config is missing
- chat `/loop` wall-clock creation persists immediately and returns the resolved timezone, local next run, UTC next run, and exact cancel command so a wrong timezone can be fixed quickly
- managed loops are created with ids, bounded by `control.loop.maxRunsPerLoop`, and capped globally by `control.loop.maxActiveLoops`
- managed loops use `skip-if-busy`, so a tick is dropped instead of stacking more queued work when the session is already busy
- managed loops persist in session state and are restored after restart
- queued prompts persist under the session entry, can be inspected with
  `clisbot queues list`, and are capped per session by
  `control.queue.maxPendingItemsPerSession` (default `20`)
- `/stop` interrupts the current run only; use `/loop cancel` to cancel loops
- `/nudge` sends one extra `Enter` to the current tmux session without resending the prompt body; use it only as a manual recovery tool when a session seems stuck after input delivery

Timezone config examples:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "timezone": "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "bots": {
    "telegram": {
      "default": {
        "groups": {
          "-1001234567890": {
            "timezone": "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh",
            "topics": {
              "4": {
                "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- agent `timezone` overrides `app.timezone` for that assistant/workspace
- route `timezone` overrides app/agent timezone for that surface
- use `clisbot timezone set <iana>` for the app default, `clisbot agents set-timezone --agent <id> <iana>` for one assistant/workspace, and `clisbot routes set-timezone ... <iana>` for one surface
- once a wall-clock loop is created, its effective timezone is persisted on that loop record
- if the service is already running, restart it after changing channel enablement
- `clisbot routes` and `clisbot routes --help` print setup guidance for Slack ids, Telegram group or topic ids, allowlists, and routed auth docs

## Loops CLI

Use `clisbot loops ...` to create, inspect, or cancel loop work from the operator CLI.

Current subcommands:

- `clisbot loops list`
- `clisbot loops status`
- `clisbot loops status --channel slack --target group:C123 --thread-id 1712345678.123456`
- `clisbot loops create --channel slack --target group:C123 --thread-id 1712345678.123456 --sender slack:U1234567890 every day at 07:00 check CI`
- `clisbot loops create --channel slack --target group:C123 --new-thread --sender slack:U1234567890 every day at 07:00 check CI`
- `clisbot loops create --channel slack --target dm:U1234567890 --new-thread --sender slack:U1234567890 every day at 09:00 check inbox`
- `clisbot loops --channel telegram --target -1001234567890 --topic-id 42 --sender telegram:1276408333 5m check CI`
- `clisbot loops --channel slack --target group:C123 --thread-id 1712345678.123456 --sender slack:U1234567890 3 review backlog`
- `clisbot loops cancel <id>`
- `clisbot loops cancel --channel slack --target group:C123 --thread-id 1712345678.123456 --all`
- `clisbot loops cancel --all`

Targeting rules:

- `--target` chooses the routed surface
- on Slack, use `group:<id>`, `dm:<user-or-channel-id>`, or raw `C...` / `G...` / `D...` ids
- on Telegram, use `group:<chat-id>` or `topic:<chat-id>:<topic-id>`; raw numeric chat ids are still accepted for compatibility
- `--thread-id` means an existing Slack thread ts
- `--topic-id` means a Telegram topic id
- omitting the sub-surface flag targets the parent Slack channel/group/DM or the parent Telegram chat
- `--new-thread` is Slack-only and creates a fresh thread anchor before the loop starts
- `--sender <principal>` is required for loop creation and records the human creator as `slack:<user-id>` or `telegram:<user-id>`
- `--sender-name <name>` and `--sender-handle <handle>` optionally store readable creator context for scheduled prompts
- in Telegram forum groups, omitting `--topic-id` targets the parent chat surface; sends then follow Telegram's normal no-`message_thread_id` behavior, which is the General topic when that forum has one

Important behavior:

- bare `list` and `status` are app-wide inventory
- scoped `list` or `status` with `--channel ... --target ...` matches one routed session
- recurring CLI-created loops reuse the same parser family as `/loop` and land in the same persisted session store
- CLI loop creation fails without `--sender` so delayed work keeps a real creator instead of rendering sender as unavailable
- the CLI accepts the same expression families as `/loop`: interval, forced interval, times/count, and wall-clock schedules
- advanced recurring `clisbot loops create` also accepts `--loop-start <none|brief|full>` to override the default scheduled start notification behavior for that one loop
- omitting the prompt body loads `LOOP.md` from the target workspace, matching maintenance-loop behavior from chat
- every row includes `agentId` and `sessionKey` because the operator CLI is app-wide rather than route-scoped
- `cancel --all` is app-wide when no routed target is given
- scoped `cancel --all` clears one routed session and scoped `cancel --all --app` clears the whole app
- if runtime is already running, it reconciles new recurring loops from persistence; if runtime is stopped, those loops activate on the next start
- count/times loops run synchronously in the CLI process today; recurring loops are persisted for the runtime scheduler
- loop state is read from `session.storePath`, which defaults to `~/.clisbot/state/sessions.json`
- if `CLISBOT_HOME` is set, the default session store becomes `<CLISBOT_HOME>/state/sessions.json`
- the runtime scheduler re-checks persisted loop state before each scheduled tick, so cancelling through the CLI suppresses future runs without adding a separate control socket
- cancelling through the CLI does not interrupt an iteration that is already running

## Start And Status Output

`clisbot start` now prints an operator summary after startup.

What it includes:

- configured agents with tool, bootstrap state, routed usage, and last activity
- configured Slack and Telegram channel summaries with connection state and last activity
- first-run guidance when no agents are configured
- bootstrap follow-up guidance when an agent workspace is `missing` or `not-bootstrapped`
- direct next steps for `clisbot --help` and the user guide when no agents are configured
- channel-specific token checks such as `Slack channel: found token...` or `Telegram channel: token not found...`
- the same operator help even when the service is already running

## Custom Token References

If your shell uses different environment variable names, pass them directly on first run:

```bash
clisbot start \
  --cli codex \
  --bot-type personal \
  --slack-app-token CUSTOM_SLACK_APP_TOKEN \
  --slack-bot-token CUSTOM_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
```

Or for Telegram:

```bash
clisbot start \
  --cli claude \
  --bot-type team \
  --telegram-bot-token CUSTOM_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
```

Important behavior:

- these values are written into `~/.clisbot/clisbot.json` as `${ENV_NAME}` placeholders
- bare env names are normalized into `${ENV_NAME}` placeholders in config
- `clisbot` does not resolve or print the secret value during config bootstrap
- this is meant for env variable names you chose, not raw secret literals
- if you still prefer manual setup, `clisbot init` accepts the same `--cli`, `--bot-type`, and token-reference flags as `clisbot start`, but it does not start the runtime

`clisbot status` now prints:

- process status, pid, config path, log path, and tmux socket
- aggregate stats for agents, bootstrapped agents, pending bootstrap agents, and running tmux sessions
- per-agent last activity
- per-channel last activity and effective connection state
- active runtime channel identity when available, such as account id, bot label, app id, and a short token fingerprint

Connection state meaning:

- `active`: channel is enabled and the runtime process is running
- `stopped`: channel is enabled in config but the runtime process is not running
- `disabled`: channel is turned off in config

## Runtime Operations

For runtime-level tuning and troubleshooting, use the dedicated guide:

- [Runtime Operations](runtime-operations.md)

That page now holds:

- turn execution timeout semantics
- long-running session commands such as `/attach`, `/detach`, and `/watch`
- runner debug commands such as `clisbot runner list|inspect|watch` and the `clisbot inspect` / `clisbot watch` shorthand
- dedicated tmux socket usage and raw tmux fallback commands
- runtime state file locations and Codex trust troubleshooting
- stale tmux cleanup behavior
- config reload rules and follow-up-state notes

## Notes

- the default workspace for agent `default` is `~/.clisbot/workspaces/default`
- tmux session names now derive from session keys, so one agent can have multiple tmux sessions at once
- the default session name template is `agents.defaults.session.name = "{sessionKey}"`
- tmux session names are created by normalizing the rendered value into a tmux-safe name, replacing every non-alphanumeric character with `-`
- prefer `clisbot runner list`, `clisbot inspect --latest`, and `clisbot watch --latest|--next` before dropping to raw tmux
- if the Codex trust screen appears stale after attaching, press `Ctrl-L` inside the tmux session to redraw the pane
