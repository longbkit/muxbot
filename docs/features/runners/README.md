# Runners

## Summary

Runners are the execution backends behind Agent-OS.

They standardize how the system talks to a concrete backend and how backend output becomes one consistent internal contract.

## State

Active

## Why It Exists

Today the project uses tmux-backed Codex sessions.

Later it may support ACP, Codex SDK, Claude SDK, or other execution backends.

That only stays coherent if backend-specific behavior is isolated behind a standard runner interface.

## Scope

- tmux runner behavior today
- future ACP runners
- future SDK runners
- standardized input, output, snapshot, and streaming contract
- backend-specific lifecycle hooks and quirks
- runner onboarding checklist for new interactive CLIs

## Non-Goals

- channel-specific transcript rendering
- canonical agent, memory, or tool ownership
- operator workflows

## Current Focus

Stabilize the tmux runner, keep Codex and Claude channel-safe through one truthful normalization contract, and define the onboarding checklist that future ACP, SDK, or CLI runners must satisfy.

Current rule for normal chat experience:

- runners normalize backend-specific terminal behavior
- channels render from the latest normalized runner view
- normal chat mode does not accumulate streaming deltas as history
- long replies still use the same rule by reconciling an ordered edited chunk set on the channel side

Current lifecycle rule:

- runners may be sunset as stale tmux sessions
- stale cleanup must not imply logical conversation reset
- if a turn exceeds the configured `maxRuntimeMin` or `maxRuntimeSec`, the runner detaches observation instead of treating the turn as failed
- that detached settlement must leave the tmux session running while monitoring continues until real completion
- channels must be able to attach new observers to that still-running session and receive truthful final settlement later
