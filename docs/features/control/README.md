# Control

## Summary

Control is the operator-facing system for inspecting and intervening in `clisbot`.

## State

Planned

## Why It Exists

The people operating the system need first-class control surfaces that are separate from end-user channels.

Attaching to tmux, checking health, restarting sessions, or clearing broken state should not be modeled as chat UX.

Session-scoped follow-up behavior changes requested by end users do not belong here.

Those belong to agents runtime policy, because they are part of the conversation contract rather than operator intervention.

Permission semantics do not belong here either.

Those belong to auth, because control is a surface that consumes auth decisions rather than the owner of the auth model.

## Scope

- inspect flows
- attach flows
- restart and stop flows
- health and debug views
- inspect and cancel persisted managed loops
- operator-safe intervention points
- config reload watch behavior

## Non-Goals

- end-user message rendering
- backend-specific runner details
- channel routing
- owning the auth model itself

## Current Focus

Turn the current ad hoc tmux inspection and recovery path into an explicit operator control surface.

Current control-owned config is:

- `control.configReload.watch`
- `control.configReload.watchDebounceMs`
